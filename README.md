Project Alistin was our effort in 2006-7 to make TTS and let J2ME apps read sms out in Myanmar language. This project include base recordings and a example player for advanced programmers who would like to start from base. An Android library with size optimized speech files will be release later. This project include female voice featured by Ma Thu Thu from City FM (around 2007) recorded in SAIL Studio.
